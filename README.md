# Race

This is a project for the german code-competition ["Big Data Predictions"](https://www.it-talents.de/foerderung/code-competition/code-competition-07-2017) in July 2017, which gives it's participants a csv-file with over 160.000 entrys which then should be analyzed.

This file contains meta-data about non real races, e.g. the date of the race, the weather and the predicted weather. The goal for the participant is to analyze it, find patterns and (maybe) find a way to predict further races.
